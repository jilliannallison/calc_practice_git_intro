Making ggplot graphs of penguin data! 

Scatterplot of body mass versus flipper length: 

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) +
                  # AES IS SPECIFICALLY FOR MATCHING VARIABLES WITH SPECIFIC AESTHETICS  
  facet_wrap(~island) +  # THIS MAKES COOL DIFFERENT SECTIONS IN THE PLOT BASED ON EACH ISLAND
  theme_minimal() + # preset themes
  labs(x = "Body Mass (g)", 
       y = "Flipper Length (mm)",
       title = "Penguin Body Mass vs Flipper Length")
